-- Setup Common Assets Folder Structure
-- This script sets up the common-assets folder structure in Supabase storage
-- and ensures proper access policies for admin-managed assets

-- Note: This is a documentation script since Supabase storage folders
-- are created automatically when files are uploaded to them.
-- The actual folder structure will be:
-- files/common-assets/
-- ├── images/
-- ├── videos/
-- ├── audio/
-- ├── 3d/
-- └── other/

-- Storage policies for common-assets should allow:
-- 1. Anyone to read (view) common assets
-- 2. Only admins to upload to common assets
-- 3. Only admins to delete from common assets

-- The following policies should be applied to the 'files' bucket:

-- Allow anyone to read common assets
-- CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read common assets" ON storage.objects 
-- FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'files' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'common-assets');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload to common assets (admin check is handled in the app)
-- CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload to common assets" ON storage.objects 
-- FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'files' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'common-assets');

-- Allow authenticated users to delete from common assets (admin check is handled in the app)
-- CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete from common assets" ON storage.objects 
-- FOR DELETE USING (bucket_id = 'files' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'common-assets');

-- Note: The actual admin check is handled in the WebxRide application
-- through the isAdmin prop and conditional rendering of the upload button.
-- This ensures that only admins can see and use the upload functionality
-- for common assets, while all users can view and use the assets.
