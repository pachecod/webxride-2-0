# Class-Based User Selection System

## Overview

The WebXRide application now features a two-step user selection process that provides better organization and security for multi-class environments.

## How It Works

### For Students (Non-Admin Users)

1. **First Step: Class Selection**
   - When a student first accesses the application, they see a dropdown with available classes
   - Each class shows the number of students enrolled
   - Students can search through classes using the search input
   - Only classes with enrolled students are shown

2. **Second Step: User Selection**
   - After selecting a class, students see only the users enrolled in that class
   - They can search through users in their selected class
   - Once a user is selected, they are "locked" to that class

3. **Class Locking**
   - After selecting a user, students can only switch between users within their assigned class
   - They cannot switch to users in other classes
   - The only way to access users in other classes is through admin tools

### For Admins

- Admins can see all classes and all users
- No class restrictions apply to admin users
- Admins can manage class assignments through the admin tools

## User Experience Flow

```
Student Access:
1. Click user selector dropdown
2. See "Choose Your Class" view
3. Select a class (e.g., "Computer Science 101")
4. See users in that class
5. Select your name
6. Now locked to that class - can only switch between classmates

Admin Access:
1. Click user selector dropdown
2. See all users across all classes
3. Can select any user or switch between classes freely
```

## Technical Implementation

### Components

- **ClassUserSelector**: New component that replaces UserSelector
- **Two-step selection process**: Class selection â†’ User selection
- **Class-based filtering**: Users are filtered by selected class
- **Persistent class assignment**: Once a user is selected, they're locked to that class

### Database Integration

- Uses existing `getStudentsWithClasses()` function
- Uses existing `getClasses()` function
- Leverages existing class-student relationships in the database

### Security Features

- Students cannot access users outside their assigned class
- Admin users maintain full access to all users and classes
- Class assignments are managed through admin tools only

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Clear separation between classes
2. **Improved Security**: Students can't access other class data
3. **Simplified UX**: Two-step process is more intuitive
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new classes and manage large numbers of students
5. **Admin Control**: Teachers can manage class assignments centrally

## Migration Notes

- Existing UserSelector component is replaced by ClassUserSelector
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Admin tools continue to work as before
- No database changes required (uses existing schema)

## Future Enhancements

- Class-specific templates
- Class-based file sharing
- Class-specific settings and permissions
- Bulk user management by class
