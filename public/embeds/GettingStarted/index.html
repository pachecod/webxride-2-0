  <p>Also known as WebXR IDE (Integrated Development Environment)</p>

  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  
  <p>To get started, select the user name above that you were given by your teacher.</p>
  <p>Then, click the slider on the left labeled "Templates and Files" to see a list of templates you can use. Click one of the templates to modify it. (If you are new here, try the Basic HTML Template.)</p>
  <p>To save a copy, click Save. You can keep working on that file as well as the CSS and Javascript files in the tabs next to index.html and save versions.</p>
  <p>When you are ready to publish something to the web, you can select the tab for the file and click Copy Code to add it to your clipboard. Then paste it wherever you put your web pages -- such as Github Pages.</p>

<h1>Change this to your first name</h1>

  <!-- Comment: If you are a kid under 13, never share your first and last name in a public web page. Safety first! -->
  
  <p>This is a paragraph where you can say a few things about yourself. If you want to say more, you can add more paragraphs. Just surround what you write with paragraph tags. Don't forget to put a / before the closing tag.</p>

  <p>Here is a second paragraph. Change it to say a few more things about yourself.</p>

 <!-- Now, put up a picture you took from your iPad. -->
 <!-- First, click the Upload button under Files at left and upload your photo. --> 
 <!-- Then, click the Copy button next to the image. Paste the link inside the ""'s below in the image tag -->

  <h2>Some of my favorite things are:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>List an item here.</li>
    <li>list another item here.</li>
    <li>Add more list items by using the li tag.</li>
  </ul>
