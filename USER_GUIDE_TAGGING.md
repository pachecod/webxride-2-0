# WebXRide File Tagging - User Guide

Complete guide to using the file tagging and search features in WebXRide 2.1.

---

## 🏷️ What are File Tags?

Tags are keywords you add to your files to organize and find them quickly. Think of them like labels or categories that you can search for later.

**Examples:**
- A nature photo: `landscape, trees, outdoor, summer`
- A sound effect: `footsteps, indoor, wood-floor, loop`
- A 3D model: `character, medieval, knight, animated`

---

## ✨ Why Use Tags?

### Find Files Faster
Instead of scrolling through hundreds of files, just search for a tag like `"landscape"` to see all your landscape files at once.

### Organize Your Work
Group related files with tags like `"project-1"`, `"final-version"`, or `"needs-editing"`

### Cross-Category Search
Tags work across ALL file types - search `"nature"` and see matching images, 3D models, and audio files together.

## 📝 How to Add Tags

### When Uploading a File

1. **Click** "Upload Files" button
2. **Select** your file(s)
3. **Enter tags** in the "Tags" field (comma-separated)
   - Example: `landscape, nature, outdoor`
4. **Click** "Upload"

✅ Your file is uploaded with tags attached!

### To Existing Files

1. **Find your file** in the file list
2. **Click** the purple tag icon (🏷️) on the file
3. **Enter or edit tags** in the popup
4. **Click** "Save Tags"

**Tips for Tags:**
- Use commas to separate tags: `tag1, tag2, tag3`
- Keep tags short and simple
- Use hyphens for multi-word tags: `sound-effect` not `sound effect`
- Be consistent: always use `landscape` not sometimes `landscapes`

## 🔍 How to Search

### Search Box

At the top of your files panel, you'll see a search box:

**Search for:**
- **Tags:** `landscape` - finds all files tagged "landscape"
- **Filenames:** `mountain` - finds all files with "mountain" in the name
- **Multiple terms:** `landscape, summer` - finds files matching either tag
- **Combinations:** Tags AND filenames both work!

The search is instant and works across all file categories.

### Browse All Tags

1. **Click** the purple **"Show Tags"** button (next to search box)
2. **See** all your tags with file counts
3. **Click** any tag to filter files
4. **View** and access matching files

**Tag Browser shows:**
- All your tags sorted by popularity (most used first)
- How many files have each tag
- Easy one-click filtering

## 💡 Tagging Best Practices

### Good Tag Examples

**For Images:**
```
landscape, mountains, sunset, colorado
portrait, professional, headshot, studio
abstract, colorful, geometric, digital-art
```

**For 3D Models:**
```
character, robot, sci-fi, animated
building, medieval, castle, textured
prop, furniture, chair, low-poly
```

**For Audio:**
```
music, ambient, calm, background
sound-effect, footsteps, concrete, loop
voice, narration, male, clear
```

**For Projects:**
```
project-mars, final, version-3
assignment-week5, draft, needs-review
demo, interactive, complete
```

### Tags to Avoid

❌ Too generic: `file`, `thing`, `stuff`  
❌ Too long: `this-is-my-really-awesome-landscape-photo`  
❌ With spaces: `nature photo` (use `nature-photo` instead)  
❌ Random characters: `!@#$%`, `test123`

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use the same tag on multiple files?**  
A: Yes! That's the whole point. Tag all related files with the same tag.

**Q: How many tags can I add to a file?**  
A: No hard limit, but 3-7 tags per file is usually ideal.

**Q: Can I see which files have no tags?**  
A: Not directly, but files without tags won't appear in tag searches.

**Q: Do tags affect file storage or performance?**  
A: No - tags are stored separately in the database and don't affect file storage or loading speed.

**Q: Can I change tags after uploading?**  
A: Yes! Click the purple tag icon on any file to edit its tags anytime.

**Q: Are tags case-sensitive?**  
A: Tags are stored as you type them, but searches are case-insensitive. `Landscape` and `landscape` will both match.

**Q: Can students see other students' tags?**  
A: No - students only see their own tags and files. Only admins can see all tags.
